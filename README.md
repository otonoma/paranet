# Welcome to the Paranet

**The Internet of Work**

**The Paranet** is a secure, distributed network designed for intelligent machine and human collaboration. Leveraging existing IP infrastructure, The Paranet creates a new layer of the internet optimized for productivity and efficient interaction between humans and machines.

The Paranet is built around core components:

- **The Paranet Network:** An overlay network that supports a new protocol to enable collaboration between actors, digital and human. 
- **Paranet Engine:** The underlying technology that powers actor execution and communication to the network for each individual paranet.
- **Paraflow:** A distributed general workflow actor language. It is a DSL (Domain Specific Language) for workflow on a network.
- **Paracord:** A React-based client application providing a visual interface to interact with deployed nodes on Paranet.

## Getting Started

### Tool Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

- **Git:** [Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- **Docker:** [Download](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- **Docker Compose:** [Download](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- **VSCode:** [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Paranet Cli
The Paranet Cli allows for easy deployments of actors and paranets to local and cloud environments.

### Install instructions
#### MacOs Prerequisites
1. OpenSSL is needed for certificates and Cognito auth. Make sure it is on your system or install it via
- `brew install openssl`
2. The github cli client `gh` is used to update the cli and authenticate docker.
- `brew install gh`
3. Login with package privileges. Follow the instructions to login through the web portal.
- `gh auth login -s read:packages`
#### Installer setup
We provide an easy install script for downloading and updating the paranet-cli.
1. First we set some environment variables for the architecture of your system. This only needs to be done once.
- For Apple arm set: `export ARCH=aarch64-apple-darwin`
- For Apple intel set: `export ARCH=x86_64-apple-darwin`
- For Linux set: `export ARCH=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`
- For Windows set: `export ARCH=x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`
2. Now we can install the script with 
- `export LOCATION=https://pn-update.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/pn-install && curl -fsSL "$LOCATION" | bash -s`

This will do the following to install the cli
- A folder will be created at `$HOME/.pn` to store cli version
- The home folder `$HOME/.pn` will be added to the `PATH` by editing either `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc`. You may need to refresh your terminal to have affect. This can also be done manually by adding the line to your shell configuration file. 
  - `export PATH="$HOME/.pn:$PATH"` 
- The `gh` client will be used to athenticate docker using this command. To login manually use
  - `gh auth token | docker login ghcr.io -u grokit-data --password-stdin`.
- The latest paranet-cli will be downloaded and linked to `pn`. If your path is set correctly you should be able to check the version anywhere on the system with `pn -V`.
- The install script will also be downloaded to `$HOME/.pn` so you can update using `pn-install` to update. Use can use `pn-install latest` or `pn-install vx.y.z` to download a specific version.
- The `ARCH` value will be set in the script so it does not need to be exported again. You can check the value with `pn-install arch`.

# Welcome to the Paranet

**The Internet of Work**

**The Paranet** is a secure, distributed network designed for intelligent machine and human collaboration. Leveraging existing IP infrastructure, The Paranet creates a new layer of the internet optimized for productivity and efficient interaction between humans and machines.

The Paranet is built around core components:

- **The Paranet Network:** An overlay network that supports a new protocol to enable collaboration between actors, digital and human. 
- **Paranet Engine:** The underlying technology that powers actor execution and communication to the network for each individual paranet.
- **Paraflow:** A distributed general workflow actor language. It is a DSL (Domain Specific Language) for workflow on a network.
- **Paracord:** A React-based client application providing a visual interface to interact with deployed nodes on Paranet.

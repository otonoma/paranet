# Documentation Site: [https://docs.paranet.ai/](https://docs.paranet.ai/)

## Overview

Our documentation is a Docusaurus based site generated from markdown files within the folder “paranet” above.

Each folder here also represents url navigation for the site, something you can explicitly define each file, with an index file representing the root of each directory. 

We leverage our index files for easier navigation to the topic category that is the focus on the rest of folder. 

## Branching

Main - production ready documentation aligned with releases
Staging - ready for review, awaiting release

**id:** a unique document ID

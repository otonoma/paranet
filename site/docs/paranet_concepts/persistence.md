# Persistence

**Persistence** in the Paranet ensures continuity and recovery for actors and the network.

## Actor State Persistence

- Actors maintain state via Paraflow, including goals, actions, and learned behaviors, across sessions.
- Ensures continuity and adaptive behavior, allowing actors to resume tasks after interruptions.

## Transaction Ledger

- An immutable record of all PnCP messages, stored in conversations for auditing and learning.
- Supports historical analysis, enabling actors to optimize strategies based on past interactions.

Persistence enables actors to build on experiences and maintain long-term objectives, a key enabler of autonomy and network resilience.

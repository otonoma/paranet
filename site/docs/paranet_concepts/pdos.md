# Paranet Distributed Actor Operating System

The Paranet functions as a distributed operating system for autonomous actors, providing infrastructure for operation, communication, and collaboration.

## Key Functions

- **Resource Management**: Nodes manage local resources and actor instances, leveraging Kubernetes for deployment and scaling.
- **Communication Orchestration**: The Paranet Broker facilitates message brokering and skill matching via PnCP.
- **Security and Trust**: Enforced through NTS and certificate management, ensuring secure interactions.
- **State Persistence**: Actors maintain state via Paraflow, with transaction ledgers recording all interactions.

This distributed OS model ensures actors can operate autonomously while contributing to the network's collective intelligence. It enhances Kubernetes by adding semantic understanding, autonomous configuration, and skill-based service placement.

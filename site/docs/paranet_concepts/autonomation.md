# Autonomy and Autonomation

**Autonomy** refers to the ability of systems to operate independently, making decisions and performing tasks with minimal human intervention. It is characterized by capabilities such as self-management, adaptation, and intelligent interaction with the environment.

**Autonomation** is the process of enabling systems to achieve autonomy. It involves integrating technologies that allow systems to reason, collaborate, learn, and adapt in real-time.

The Paranet is an autonomation platform designed to support the following ten essential elements of autonomy:

1. **Environmental Awareness**: Perceiving and interpreting the surrounding context, including organizational-level insights via transaction ledgers.
2. **Independent Decision Making**: Making choices without external control, based on local data and embedded goals.
3. **Collaborative Intelligence**: Working effectively with other systems or humans, sharing skills and tasks dynamically.
4. **Coordination through Orchestration**: Synchronizing activities across multiple entities, with decentralized orchestrators for resilience.
5. **Planning and Goal Setting**: Defining objectives and strategies, with dynamic adjustments based on network conditions.
6. **Task Execution**: Performing actions to achieve goals, leveraging skill-based task distribution.
7. **Learning and Adaptation**: Improving performance based on experience, using transaction ledgers for analysis.
8. **Exception Handling**: Managing errors or unexpected situations autonomously, with assistance from other actors if needed.
9. **Delegation**: Assigning tasks to other entities based on current capabilities, facilitated by skill matching.
10. **Self Awareness and Memory**: Maintaining an understanding of one's state and history, ensuring continuity and adaptive behavior.

Traditional software architectures often lack the inherent design to support these elements fully. The Paranet addresses this by providing a framework that enables distributed intelligence and actor-based collaboration, allowing systems to achieve genuine autonomy.

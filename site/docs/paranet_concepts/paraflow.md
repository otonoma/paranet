# Paraflow - A New Paradigm Language

**Paraflow** is a programming language designed specifically for autonomy within the Paranet. It enables actors to plan, reason, and execute tasks autonomously, addressing limitations of conventional languages.

## Key Features

- **Persistence**: Actors maintain state across sessions, supporting long-term autonomy and continuity.
- **Events**: External inputs trigger actor behaviors, enabling reactive autonomy, with decorators for skill integration.
- **Rules**: Define goal decomposition for complex planning, using patterns for conditional execution.
- **Tasks**: Procedural steps for goal execution, integrating with external services or delegating via PnCP.
- **Control Flow**: Conditional and iterative constructs tailored for autonomous contexts, supporting dynamic workflows.

## Why Paraflow?

Traditional languages lack inherent support for distributed reasoning and semantic interaction. Paraflow:

- Enables dynamic planning and execution of goals, with interpretable runtime states for transparency.
- Supports actorization of existing code, bridging legacy systems with autonomous frameworks.
- Integrates seamlessly with the Paranet's skill-based communication and NTS security model.

Paraflow empowers developers to build genuinely autonomous systems capable of independent decision-making and adaptation, modeling complex workflows and supporting human-like planning cycles.

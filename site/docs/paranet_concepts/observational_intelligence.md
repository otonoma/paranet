# Extensibility and Observational Intelligence

The Paranet supports extensibility and observational intelligence, crucial for autonomous learning and adaptation.

## Extensibility

- **Custom Skill Matching**: Allows tailored logic for specific applications, enhancing network flexibility.
- **Actor-Based Extensions**: New functionalities introduced via specialized actors, supporting incremental evolution.
- **Subprotocol Support**: Enables integration of diverse protocols, secured by NTS, for enhanced interoperability.

## Observational Intelligence

- **Observation Engine**: Actors can subscribe to message streams for monitoring, based on skill definitions or actor identities.
- **Continuous Learning**: Actors learn and adapt by observing network activities, leveraging transaction ledgers for analysis.

These features ensure the Paranet evolves with requirements and actors improve through observation, supporting dynamic, scalable autonomous systems.

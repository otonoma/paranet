# Actors

An **actor** in the Paranet is any entity capable of autonomous action, decision-making, or interaction. Actors are the primary units of computation and intelligence, enabling distributed autonomy across the network.

## Characteristics of Actors

- **Identity**: Each actor has a unique, cryptographically secured identifier, ensuring authenticity and security.
- **State**: Actors maintain persistent states, including capabilities, actions, and goals, managed through Paraflow.
- **Task Execution**: Actors perform tasks based on their skills, either independently or in response to requests.
- **Autonomous Interaction**: Actors can reason, plan, and make decisions using distributed capabilities, adapting to changing conditions.

## Types of Actors

- **Software Agents**: Autonomous programs or services running on nodes.
- **Hardware Devices**: Physical devices like robots or IoT sensors running software, integrated as actors.
- **Human Users**: People interacting with the Paranet, contributing skills and decisions as actors.

Actors collaborate by sharing skills and communicating via PnCP, forming a network where autonomy emerges from their collective interactions. They support semantic, capability-based communication, enhancing interoperability and adaptability.

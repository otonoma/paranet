# Distributed Intelligence

**Distributed Intelligence** is the collective capability of autonomous actors to reason, learn, and adapt across the Paranet. It enables:

- **Local Decision Making**: Actors make context-based decisions, leveraging local data and skills.
- **Collaborative Problem Solving**: Actors share skills and delegate tasks, enhancing collective efficiency.
- **Emergent Behavior**: The network exhibits intelligent behavior beyond individual actors, driven by skill interactions.

The Paranet's architecture, with its skill-based communication and autonomous actors, fosters this distributed intelligence, enhancing resilience and adaptability. It contrasts with distributed information, focusing on semantic relevance over location-based addressing.

# Paranet Concepts Overview

The Paranet is an innovative Internet overlay designed to support distributed intelligence and autonomy, developed by Otonoma as outlined in "Paranet: The Automation Platform for the Autonomous Internet" by Jim Harding, February 2025. It represents a paradigm shift from traditional computing models, enabling a network of autonomous actors to collaborate, reason, and adapt in dynamic environments. This document introduces the core concepts that define the Paranet, providing a foundation for understanding its architecture, functionality, and potential impact.

## Core Concepts

The Paranet ecosystem is built around several interconnected concepts, each detailed in its own documentation file:

- **Autonomy and Autonomation**: Explores the process of making systems autonomous and the ten essential elements that define autonomy, supported by the Paranet's autonomation platform.
- **Paranet Node Architecture**: Describes the structure and components of a Paranet node, the fundamental unit hosting actors and enabling network operations.
- **Actors**: Defines the entities capable of autonomous action within the Paranet, including their characteristics and roles in the network.
- **Paraflow - A New Paradigm Language**: Introduces Paraflow, a language designed for autonomy, enabling actors to plan, reason, and execute tasks effectively.
- **Skill Definitions and Matching**: Details how skills are defined and dynamically matched to actors, facilitating capability-based collaboration.
- **Paranet Collaboration Protocol (PnCP)**: Explains the protocol governing actor communication, supporting flexible and secure interactions.
- **Paranet Distributed Actor Operating System**: Outlines how the Paranet functions as a distributed OS, managing resources and orchestration for autonomous actors.
- **Distributed Intelligence**: Discusses the collective intelligence emerging from actor interactions, emphasizing semantic relevance over location-based communication.
- **Extensibility and Observational Intelligence**: Highlights the Paranet's ability to evolve and learn through extensible design and network observation.
- **Persistence**: Covers how state and transaction data are maintained, ensuring continuity and learning in autonomous operations.
- **Security**: Examines the Negative Trust Security (NTS) model, ensuring robust protection in a decentralized, autonomous network.

These concepts collectively enable the Paranet to bridge the IT/OT divide, support multi-vendor environments, and drive the future of autonomous systems across industries.

## Terminology

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the Paranet documentation:

- **Autonomation**: The process of making systems or devices autonomous, enabling them to operate with minimal human intervention.
- **Paranet**: An Internet overlay designed to support distributed intelligence and autonomy, facilitating collaboration among autonomous actors.
- **Actor**: Any entity capable of autonomous action, decision-making, or interaction within the Paranet. Actors can be software agents, hardware devices, or human users.
- **Skill**: A specific capability or functionality that an actor can offer or request, defined by a subject and action pair.
- **PnCP (Paranet Collaboration Protocol)**: The protocol enabling actor-to-actor communication and collaboration based on skills.
- **Paraflow**: A programming language designed specifically for autonomy, allowing actors to plan, reason, and execute tasks autonomously.
- **Node (Paranode)**: A computation abstraction that hosts actors and facilitates their interactions within the Paranet.
- **Affiliation**: A formal relationship between nodes that allows them to recognize and interact with each other's actors based on trust and shared objectives.
- **NTS (Negative Trust Security)**: A security model that assumes no inherent trust and continuously verifies actor behavior to ensure network integrity.
- **PDNS (Paranet Domain Name Service)**: A service for provisioning and managing Paranet domains and names.
- **Transaction Ledger**: An immutable record of all PnCP messages, used for auditing, learning, and maintaining state.
- **Skill Matcher**: An algorithm within the Paranet Broker that matches skill requests to actors capable of fulfilling them.
- **Observation Engine**: A component that allows actors to observe network messages, supporting monitoring and learning.

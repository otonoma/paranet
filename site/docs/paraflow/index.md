# Paraflow

Welcome to the **Paraflow** section of the Paranet documentation! This section will help you understand the basics of The Paranet's language, **Paraflow**. 

Paraflow actors operate within a Paranet.  They can implement skills (i.e. receive and fulfill requests) and they can delegate work (i.e. make requests that help achieve their goals) to other actors on the network.

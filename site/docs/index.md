# Introduction

Welcome to the Paranet documentation!

## What Is the Paranet?

The Paranet is a secure skills network for intelligent machine collaboration. It utilizes the existing IP infrastructure and, for all intents and purposes, it's another internet. There are many "internets" such as the Web, the Onion Router (Tor), and the Internet of Things (IoT). The Web supports social networking, e-commerce, entertainment, and so on. IoT is a network of connected devices, and Tor is for secure, anonymous communication. The Paranet is fundamentally designed for work productivity, and we consider it to be the Internet of Work (IoW). It optimizes human-to-machine and machine-to-machine collaboration.

The Paranet is as much an operating system as it is a network. Effectively, it is the first general-purpose distributed intelligence operating system (PDOS). The machines of the PDOS are called **actors**. Actors originated from early AI research at MIT, and several technologies have been based on them for distributed concurrent processes. Our actors are next-generation types that have their own AI language to run on the PDOS. They are heterogeneous, decoupled processes that run over the network with no process dependencies. Their language, **Paraflow**, is the first of its kind to emulate how humans plan, complete goals, manage workflows, and collaborate to perform work collectively.

## How to Use These Docs

On the left side of the screen, you'll find the documentation navigation bar. The pages are categorized by different areas of the technology that make up or support the use of the Paranet.

We have the classic **Getting Started** section, **Paraflow**—our general-purpose workflow language—and various **Developer Tools** we're consistently building upon and maintaining to support your Paranet journey.

However, you can read them in any order or skip to the pages that apply to your use case.

On the right side of the screen, you'll see a table of contents that makes it easier to navigate between sections of a page.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

To get the most out of our docs, it's recommended that you have a technical background. You'll find Rust principles in Paraflow, as well as React and JSON-based knowledge requirements within features we offer in our client **Paracord**.

Also, having a basic understanding of the **Actor Model**, popularized by Carl Hewitt, will help you grasp the philosophy behind the technology.
